# Public Debt Group Exercise

This repository contains the group project for Public Debt tasks, split into two main components:

## 1. Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb)

The Jupyter Notebook (`public_debt_exercises.ipynb`) provides the solutions for the eight exercises for public debt. Each debt type is identified by the 'Series Code'. This is further explored and explained at the end of the notebook, so it can be used properly for the functions.


## 2. Python Script (.py)

The Python script (`app.py`) has the functions from the Jupyter Notebook and integrates them into a Streamlit web application. To run the application, execute the following command in your terminal:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

Or under [this](https://ieuadvancedcoding2-j24fsitwtbfwejvs6iby7g.streamlit.app) link hostd on Streamlit Community Cloud.
